# TeamCity (Build Server) with PostgreSQL
A TeamCity image that installs TeamCity Server v9.1 from the binaries found at jetbrains.com (http://download.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) and configures it to use PostgreSQL. Built on top of the official debian (jessie) base image plus the java 8 run time environment.
